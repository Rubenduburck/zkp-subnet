## Introduction

Bittensor subnets are a great way to provide open APIs aimed at outsourcing certain computational workloads, whether it be model inference, distributed learning or other highly specific compute. However, a key insight seems to be missing from most subnets out there today, which is that almost none of them seem to coordinate their miners to collaborate in order to achieve greater computational power; instead, they seem to often either perform computation redundantly, or miners are instead pitted in competition with each other, which may allow for a free market dynamic in the way of creating models, but severely limits the size of said models. We believe that Bittensor will only be fully leveraged if subnets begin thinking more deeply about collaborative mining, rather than redundant or competitive strategies. This is where Apollo comes in; a Bittensor subnet aimed at fruitfully combining compute power to achieve competitive results on the open market.
